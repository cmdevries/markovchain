# Markovify
Fetch text from p tags in URLs and generate text using markov chains with
transition probabilities learned from the text.

## Usage 
The program takes a list of URLs to scrape via command line arguments.

    $ ./markovify.py https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion

And then it randomly generates often humourus text based on the probabilities
of word transitions in the text scraped from these URLs.
